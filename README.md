# Theoretical Neuroscience Project

### This repository contains all the code I wrote during a Theoretical Neuroscience Project I undertook in 2020-2021

Note that the notebooks by themseleves do not cover the theory in any significant detail and are purely for the purpose of simulating different partial differential equations and neuron models.

I have included [the full writeup](https://github.com/r-reji/theoreticalNeuroscienceCode/blob/main/Theoretical_Neuroscience_Project___Final_Report.pdf) of the project which I wrote at the end of 2021. I have been made aware that a few of the figures have interefered with the formatting when the original LaTeX document was converted to a .pdf.
