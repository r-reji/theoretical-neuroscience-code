# Theoretical Neuroscience Project

### This repository contains all the code I wrote during a Theoretical Neuroscience Project I undertook in 2020-2021

Note that the notebooks by themselves do not cover the theory in any significant detail and are purely for the purpose of simulating different partial differential equations and neuron models.

I have included [the full write-up](https://github.com/r-reji/theoreticalNeuroscienceCode/blob/main/Theoretical_Neuroscience_Project___Final_Report.pdf) of the project which I wrote at the end of 2021. The formatting issues should be fixed but if any remain please inform me.
